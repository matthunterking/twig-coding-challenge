# Twig Education Coding Challenge

## Task
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays.

Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder.

### Example pseudo-code:

```
groupArrayElements([​1​, ​2​, ​3​, ​4,​ ​5​], ​3​);
// [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ]
```

## How to use

In the root directory run 
`npm install`

To run the tests run
`npm test` 

My solution to the task is stored in `index.js` and the tests can be found in `test.js`.
